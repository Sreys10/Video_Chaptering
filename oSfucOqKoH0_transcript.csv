0,0.03,this is a YouTube video chapter you see
1,2.28,there's little marks on the play bar
2,3.51,when you run your mouse over them they
3,5.609,tell you what's in the section of the
4,7.2,video and they could transform the
5,9.48,weight viewers and creators use YouTube
6,11.099,forever by destroying watch time I'll
7,13.349,get onto that in a minute
8,14.4,just after I'd show you how they work
9,19.76,these chapters have been around forever
10,22.26,in the form of timestamp timestamps a
11,24.539,little bits of text you can add to your
12,26.099,comment section or description section
13,28.32,with a label when the timestamp is
14,30.66,clicked it simply takes you to the part
15,32.61,of the video with the information in
16,34.2,that label that's exactly how these
17,36.329,chapters will work - it's still up to
18,38.01,the creator's to put the information in
19,39.54,so they work and it needs to be in the
20,41.219,description of the video but that is the
21,42.93,only thing that can stop this from
22,44.399,transforming the platform forever whole
23,46.53,time I guess 9 a second the great thing
24,48.27,is anyone who's already been doing this
25,49.98,for years will have their chapters put
26,52.079,in automatically so now you know here's
27,55.26,the exciting bit and why it could mean
28,56.85,YouTube is never the same again the
29,59.52,thing that sucks about video and why
30,61.649,blogs are still so handy as a blog is
31,63.899,labeled up you can just skip to the bit
32,65.909,you care about by quickly reading a
33,67.5,headline now this could be why the
34,69.33,chapters annihilate creators watch times
35,71.97,think about all of those videos you've
36,74.04,watched with people ramble on for too
37,75.54,long
38,75.78,spend a big inning of their video
39,77.369,plugging their course and give you
40,79.229,content as 20 minutes long for two
41,81.0,minutes of the info you wanted you know
42,83.009,who you are I honestly believe someone's
43,84.99,having to do this on purpose to derive
44,86.52,more watch time and larger channels with
45,88.979,more subscribers get away with it
46,90.659,because they've already got loads of
47,91.92,subscribers but if viewers start Demond
48,94.11,the chapters fight back at the craters
49,95.85,and we're not kind enough to add them
50,97.17,then maybe they'll have to do so the
51,99.57,thing that is exciting for the creators
52,101.189,is these timestamps could help Google
53,103.409,know more about us in your video right
54,105.509,now it uses captions to help provide
55,107.7,relevant video content people searching
56,109.53,for key words you get shown this
57,111.21,tremendous video and then it pulls the
58,113.52,relevant section to your search going
59,114.869,out and highlights it good chapters
60,117.24,timestamps give Google more information
61,119.369,as to what the content of your video
62,121.079,contains are these timestamps going to
63,123.0,be another chance to give YouTube and
64,124.409,Google ranking signals I think so let me
65,127.079,know what you think in the comments as
66,128.879,creators we owe it to our viewers to
67,130.619,help them out if we're in and educate
68,132.64,Scheckter the guys out there making
69,134.62,comedy or entertainment well really
70,136.51,gonna provide some of the values to your
71,137.83,channel but how do we use these chapters
72,140.38,stop our water time crashing I'm calling
73,143.17,them cliffhangers think about every soap
74,145.6,opera you've ever watched the last scene
75,147.55,of an episode builds up tension and in
76,149.26,cuts leaving you to wonder what has
77,151.87,happened and this is done so that you
78,154.09,come back next time when planning your
79,156.34,videos adding cliffhangers to each
80,158.02,section won't work is another thing for
81,159.97,creative do but I think the best way to
82,162.01,do it would be to find out and the next
83,164.14,chapter over YouTube chapters okay maybe
84,167.59,not that far but self expectations give
85,170.739,them some information that sounds
86,172.06,interesting or important at the start of
87,173.98,each chapter and say you'll cover it in
88,176.14,the next as I did with the killing watch
89,178.72,time comments throughout this video
90,180.37,maybe not as obvious as I was about it
91,182.739,yeah now you know I kept repeating
92,184.12,myself and wasn't being a little bit the
93,186.01,next thing you could do is to name your
94,188.35,chapters more like people to video
95,189.88,titles so instead of the second section
96,191.38,being called how to sell chapters you
97,193.54,could name it at setting up chapters to
98,195.04,double your watch time
99,196.12,anyone who thinks they already know how
100,197.59,to do it might think it looks worth
101,199.989,watching
102,200.62,of course don't make this clickbait you
103,203.56,can also refer to previous chapters so
104,205.51,let's say someone skip straight to
105,206.89,chapter 4 you could say like in chapter
106,209.049,2 where I was telling you how to get a
107,210.43,hundred thousand views in a day and then
108,212.35,if that syncs up with the title of
109,214.15,chapter two happy days again not
110,216.25,clickbait this will only really work if
111,218.32,users begin to demand chapters if
112,220.15,YouTube gives videos with a more
113,222.579,authority and views and if creators
114,224.95,Natalie Adam if they still remain
115,227.23,something that happened here and there
116,229.66,will never see you to take over blogs
117,232.06,with the one awesome feature that they
118,233.89,have skipping to the bit readers care
119,235.69,about bang are you thinking then make
120,237.4,sure you subscribe so you can SAP state
121,239.53,with YouTube you learn to make better
122,240.76,videos and grow your channel if you'd
123,242.98,like to learn all about how to rank
124,244.63,inserts to get six bigger views and
125,247.03,check out this video here and if you
126,248.859,watch it and think nonsense watch this
127,250.87,video here which hits it's level three
